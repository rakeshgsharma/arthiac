Next up, we move to Brighton, where we will be covering up for "The Seagulls." Four years ago, Brighton made their leap into the Premier League after sealing a 2-1 victory over Wigan Athletic. Since then, the Seagulls have had three successful campaigns in the English Top-Flight in terms of staying up and avoiding relegation.

The 2020-21 season has arguably been Brighton’s best ever (in points and style of play) season since they returned to the Premier League.

We look into every department that the Seagulls have to offer for FPL managers around the world that would want to consider a potential opening for Brighton asset(s) to enter their teams.

Under head coach Graham Potter, Brighton were really impressive last season. They have been playing "gorgeous" football throughout the Premier League campaign.

This Brighton side, under the guidance of coach Graham Potter, have a lot of players that could prove to be a key factor in providing points for their FPL teams. In this article, we will take a look at Brighton’s guaranteed/potential key players, starters and player potential. Stay tuned!

## Brighton & Hove Albion in 2020-21

---

Despite finishing the Premier League season in 16th, Brighton have been one of those teams that have shown Premier League followers what they are made up of as a team. There were lingering doubts that Graham Potter and his men may succumb to the relegation zone due to the fierce competition and armory that the other teams displayed.

But, against all odds, Brighton kept their doubters aside and went on to provide fans with breath-taking performances, especially when it came to the big boys.

Brighton have very rarely had a bad day on the pitch. There were patches of brilliance from this Brighton side that made us feel that they belong in the top half of the Premier League table.

Recent colossal performances against Tottenham Hotspur and Liverpool were the cornerstones from which Brighton built upon. Those performances strengthened their position to have another Premier League campaign.

Excluding the wins against Spurs and Liverpool, Brighton had provided fans with one of the games of the season where they took down Manchester City 3-2 at the Amex Stadium in Brighton. The Seagulls have had many other exemplary performances throughout the campaign. A 3-3 draw against Wolves, a 2-2 draw against West Ham, and a 1-0 win against high-flying Leeds United were a few examples of how concrete this team is when they bond together.

Adding to the results above, even when the Seagulls lost, there were so many positives that were to be seen.

## What to Expect from Brighton & Hove Albion in the FPL?

---

This season, the Seagulls are going to be much more clinical in front of goal and we should see that they provide FPL managers with a lot of points on offer.

In the 2020-21 campaign, Brighton created a zillion opportunities to get themselves goals, but there wasn’t a player to get at the end of all the creativity that Brighton had on offer.

Having said that, Brighton are going to be a real menace this season as they bid to have an extraordinary campaign once again with a higher objective this season.

Brighton are not a team that shies away from their opponents. They play an attractive brand of football that caught the eye of Pep Guardiola as their style of play continues to catch the eye of their fans and those across the football community.

## Players as Potential "Regular" Starters

---

### Goalkeeper

1. **Sanchez -** **£4.5m** - Robert Sanchez took over the reins from the Australian goalkeeper Matt Ryan after Graham Potter didn’t favour him in goal. Robert Sanchez has been phenomenal when called upon to take over and fill the boots of Matt Ryan.

   A commanding and good shot-stopper who is very proactive in the way he approaches the game as well as in his decision-making. Most importantly, there is a good mutual understanding between him and his defenders.

   This season, Brighton will be a much better side with and without the ball. Even if Brighton fall against the extreme quality of the big boys, Sanchez is more than capable of getting save points.

   Adding to that, he is a regular starter in the Brighton set-up and he costs just 4.5m in the FPL game. That is a real bargain for what he brings in terms of saves and clean sheet potential.

   Despite making his debut midway through the 2020-21 season, Sanchez has pulled out 66 saves despite making 23 appearances in the Premier League. Here is the upside of having Sanchez on your team. If Brighton keeps a clean-sheet, Sanchez is most likely to be among the bonus-point contenders.

   He is a reliable penalty-stopper as well. Get him in your FPL teams and we at Arthiac football count on his services.

### Defenders

1. **Dunk** - **Centre-back** - **£5.0m** - Lewis Dunk is the captain of this Brighton side. He has an overall package to his game that makes him a standout option if you are looking for a defender to choose from the Seagulls.

   In set-pieces, he is the main man who is targeted to get a header or two. His physical presence is rock-solid, along with an impeccable towering aerial factor that makes him a good source of points in defensive and attacking terms.

   He’s also got free-kicks under his belt. He is pretty reliable personnel to be on free-kicks as well, which further boosts his potential for FPL points.

   In the 2020-21 season, he has a total of 5 goals in 33 appearances for the club in the Premier League. However, his disciplinary record is a slight factor to look out for as he collected 5 yellows and 2 red cards in those 33 appearances. He provides a good overall package as a defensive option at 5.0m.

2. **Veltman** - **Right-back** - **£4.5m** - Joel Veltman has stepped up in place of Tariq Lamptey, whose season was cut short due to his persistent hamstring injuries. But, Joel Veltamn was not a dull FPL option to consider.

   Last season, Veltman made 28 appearances in the Premier League in the Brighton shirt and scored a goal and provided an assist to add to his contributions.

   At times, he carries with him a good attacking threat with the ball at his feet. But, he is a slightly conservative defender.

   If you are an FPL manager looking for a defensive option just for "clean sheets", then Joel Veltman is a good differential option that you can consider having in your team at 4.5m.

3. **Lamptey** - **Right-back** - **£4.5m** - This young lad is a fierce competitor despite his short stature. He’s got electrifying speed and pace in him and takes on defenders for fun on the outside. His deliveries are glorious if he gets them right on the money.

   Despite his stop-start campaign over the last two seasons, Tariq Lamptey is still a good FPL defensive wing-back option to consider. His attacking numbers in many games are through the roof.

   You may have to wait a while before you get him into your FPL teams since he is nursing a hamstring injury from which he has been suffering on a continuous basis.

4. **Burn** - **Centre-Back** - **£4.5m** - Dan Burn is another huge figure in the Brighton back-line. Despite his huge stature, Dan Burn provides a decent and sizable threat in attack too. He does possess a good aerial threat when it comes to set-pieces. Last season, he scored his first goal for Brighton in a 3-2 win against Manchester City in an epic game that saw emotions run high at the Amex Stadium.

### Midfielders

1. **Trossard** - **£6.5m** - Leandro Trossard is a baller in this Brighton & Hove Albion side. He is consistently out there providing chance after after chance for his team mates to poach on to one. He is a silky footballer who has a lot of creativity in his play to help FPL managers get points through goals and assists.

   He is quick on the ball and demonstrates good control over it. He is on set-piece duty to boost his potential for FPL points.

   A notable aspect of his game is also his ability to score goals. He doesn’t shy away from having a crack at goal from a distance. He is a key member of this Brighton side as he is a clever footballer.

   His numbers were quite impressive last season. This Brighton & Hove Albion side provides points all over the pitch. Considering all that, Trossard has made 35 appearances for the club in the Premier League, where he registered 5 goals and 5 assists throughout the campaign. There is more to come from this Belgian starlet.

   His movements are sublime as he finds open spaces for himself as well as his fellow team-mates. There is no doubt that his game is going from strength to strength and it will continue to get better this season.

2. **GroB** - **£6.0m** - Pascal GroB is an essential piece of the puzzle that Graham Potter has put in place for this Brighton side. He is a key player for the Seagulls as he supplies quality deliveries from any part of the pitch that leads to goal-scoring opportunities.

   He is a calm personality on the pitch and always keeps the ball at his feet and has a cutting edge in his passes that makes opposition defenders scramble around him.

   His numbers during the 2020-21 Premier League campaign have to be considered to a great extent. He made 35 appearances for the Seagulls where he scored 3 goals and further provided 8 assists to round off his Premier League season.

   Additionally, he is on set piece and penalty duty and, if you have him in your FPL team, he is a very reliable penalty taker.

3. **March** - **£5.5m** - Solly March has been undeniably one of Brighton’s impressive players on the pitch before his injury that had ruled him out for the rest of the season in the 2020-21 campaign.

   He provided a huge threat on the left-hand side of Brighton’s attack, where he kept creating chances regularly.

   His numbers before his injury are to be considered in case you opt for a differential player. During the 2020-21 campaign, Solly March made 21 appearances where he scored twice and provided an assist for Brighton last season.

   Though his numbers may not be attractive, he is not a bad option to consider on any given day of a particular game-week.

4. **Bissouma** - **£4.5m** - Yves Bissouma is currently on the transfer lists of many top European clubs. It will be interesting to see if Brighton lets him leave for a substantial fee or not.

   Keeping his transfer talk aside, Yves Bissouma is a colossal figure in this Brighton team. He demonstrates good attacking and defensive sides to his game. He is very athletic and fit. His fitness levels are very important to Brighton as his presence on the field is worth mentioning. He does have a serious long-range goal in him, as he has shown in the past.

   Our Opinion - He is a good bench option to consider.

### Forwards

1. **Maupay** - **£6.5m** - Neal Maupay had an unpredictable season the last time out as his performances on the pitch were slightly tarnished due to his behavioural issues. Although, he still remains one of the prime candidates to score goals for Brighton upfront.

   The following are his numbers over the last two Premier League campaigns:

   | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | Premier League <br /> 2019-20 | 37      | 10    | 3       |
   | Premier League <br /> 2020-21 | 33      | 8     | 2       |

   Neal Maupay has been delivering consistent numbers for FPL managers to consider in case he hits the ground running. He is also one of the potential penalty takers in this Brighton & Hove Albion side.

2. **Welbeck** - **£6.0m** - Danny Welback has risen out of the ashes since he made a move to Brighton & Hove Albion. He is a player that never gives up trying. He is constantly at you bringing in his experience and quality in play at crucial moments.

   Though his career has been interrupted by injuries, it seems as though Danny Welbeck has found a new home at the Amex.

   He is a very reliable striker and is a constant source of FPL points if he gets into his groove. He can be the man who makes a big difference in tight games by chipping in with a goal or two that settles the final scoreline. The following are his Premier League numbers from the 2020-21 campaign:

   | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | Premier League <br /> 2020-21 | 24      | 6     | 1       |

   Danny Welbeck was patiently waiting for his chance and when Graham Potter offered it to him, he sealed his opportunity. This goes to show that Danny Welbeck is a man with ambition, zeal and fight, which is a good sign if you are an FPL manager.

   Catch the train when Danny Welbeck is in full swing in front of the Goal!
