Conor Gallagher was the star-boy for Crystal Palace as the Eagles mounted the pressure on Everton's Rafael Benitez after their impressive win. Check out our player ratings of the game between the Eagles and the Toffees.

### 1. Vicente Guaita: 6.5

The Spaniard had a decent game in between the sticks for the Eagles as he pulled out a really good save at the end to deny the equalizing goal from Everton.

### 2. Joel Ward: 6

The right-back was able to keep himself within touching distance of Demarai Gray and limit the threat of the Everton forward. He did well to guide and marshall his backline.

### 3. James Tomkins: 6.5

The centre-back had a decent game and limited Everton's forwards to make a significant impact in the game while they were on the attack. He did really well to find himself in a position where he got the ball at his feet and poked it home to give the hosts a two goal lead.

### 4. Marc Guehi: 7

He was a much more solid and enterprising personnel in the Palace backline. He won a lot of duels in the air and denied Richarlison and Rondon to a great extent. He keeps growing and growing.

### 5. Tyrick Mitchell: 6.5

The youngster had a pretty good game overall. Until Everton had pulled a goal back, kept bombarding forward and assisted Zaha to make his forward runs many times during the game. He probably grew tired as the game wore on and was left exposed.

### 6. Will Hughes: 7

The midfielder had a really good game in midfield as he kept pushing his team forward with his little runs and his fine passes. He deserved a lot of credit for his performance on the day.

He will get the assist for the Eagles' second goal. Subbed off later in the second half.

### 7. Cheikhou Kouyate: 6

He kept things simple and mopped up whenever required. Given how poor Everton were in the first half, he even found himself in attacking positions for short spells in between the game.

### 8. Conor Gallagher: 9.5

The Chelsea loanee just gets better and better with each game passing by. It was an all-round performance by the England international as he has become the fans favourite at Selhurst Park. It was a performance that was perfect in terms of goong forward and tracking back as well.

He scored two goals on the day with his first being a simple finish, while his second goal was a beauty. It is a goal that will contend for this month's "goal of the month" award. Top bins!

### 9. Jordan Ayew: 6.5

It was clearly one of the best games that Ayew has had in a Palace shirt. His drive and determination down the right wings tested the Everton defence. He got an assist in the game.

### 10. Odsonne Edouard: 6

After starting the season well, the striker is looking to make an impact once again and impress his manager to get a regular starting spot in the playing XI.

He had a few good moments in the game with a few good touches on the ball. Subbed off for Benteke later on in the second half.

### 11. Wilfred Zaha: 5.5

The Ivorian wasn't able to make an attacking impact in the game. Got into an argument with Fabian Delph earlier in the game. He had an off day by his standards.

## Substitutes

### 12. Jeffrey Schlupp: 4

He couldn't make a difference as he found it difficult to get in the rhythm of the game.

### 13. Christian Benteke: 3

The Belgian striker was probably lucky not to be sent off late in the second half after a rash tackle on Everton's Coleman.

### 14. Nathaniel Clyne: N/A
