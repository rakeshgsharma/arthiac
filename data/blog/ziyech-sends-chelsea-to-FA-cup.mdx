Premier League giants Chelsea and run-away Premier League winners Manchester City locked horns at the iconic Wembley Stadium in London for their FA Cup semi-final. The FA Cup is one of Pep Guardiola’s potential opportunities to add to Manchester City’s trophy cabinet, whereas Thomas Tuchel aims to win his first as Chelsea’s Head Coach.

Man City were sluggish for most of the first half as they struggled to adapt to Chelsea's high press and pattern of play. Man City were ordinary in the first half with multiple errors as Chelsea closed down on Manchester City, forcing out issues for Pep's men in blue. De Bruyne and Sterling were off their best as Chelsea kept building from behind, pushing their wingbacks high up the field to have an attempt at goal.

The second half didn’t begin on a positive note for Man City as Kevin De Bruyne limped off with an issue with his ankle, which is a slight concern considering the quadruple that Man City aim for this season. Hakim Ziyech rubbed salt in City’s wounds as Timo Werner sprinted behind the Man City defence to lay his pass on a plate for Ziyech to scoop it into the back of the net to give Chelsea a much deserved lebar. A lofted pass over Man City’s defence presented another opportunity for Ziyech to add another goal, but Zack Steffen came out big to keep Man City in the hunt for an equaliser.

Man City lacked creativity and Pep Guardiola turned to his bench to bring on the likes of Phil Foden and Gundogan, who brought energy and a different dynamic to City’s attack to break through Chelsea’s defence. A half chance arrived at City’s disposal, but Ruben Dias headed it high above the bar. Man City dominated for huge chunks of the second half, but Chelsea’s stubborn defence held out the ammunition that Pep Guardiola had thrown in.

It was a London club that knocked out Man City again in the semi-finals and Thomas Tuchel, along with his men, will face either Leicester or Southampton at Wembley a month later as he has a chance to write his own little history at Chelsea. Upwards and Onwards from now on for Chelsea as they aim to battle along with West Ham and Liverpool to claim the Champions League spots when they take on Brighton and Hove Albion in the League.
