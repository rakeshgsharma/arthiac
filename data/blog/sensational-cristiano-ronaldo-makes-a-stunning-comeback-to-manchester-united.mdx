Cristiano Ronaldo set the internet on fire as he set his sights on making his mark in the Premier League
once again in his illustrious career on the pitch.

The Portuguese superstar has agreed to join the Red Devils after days of negotiations with the blue side of Manchester, which eventually fell off.

The 36-year old icon has signed for Manchester United in a €15 million deal with a potential €8 million in add-ons that would go to Juventus.

The school boys and fans from the red side of Manchester will be over the moon courtesy of the signing of the 5 time Ballon D'or Winner and there will be no surprise to see the tickets sold out every time Manchester plays at home in the Theatre of Dreams.

For a large portion of the summer transfer window, Cristiano's transfer away from the Italian capital was a topic to keep an eye on even though he had made his intentions clear that his call on his future would be made after the Euro's.

If you think about it in financial terms, there were only 3 clubs who were able to get the services of the Portuguese and they were PSG, Manchester City and Real Madrid.

Manchester United never made the cut into the transfer conversation as they had fixed their gaze on signing Sancho and Varane in the transfer market as their primary recruitments.

PSG have stated through Nasser-Al-Khelaifi that signing Cristiano Ronaldo wasn't even in their thoughts.

According to rumours, Real Madrid were in transfer speculation for a while, which was denied by Carlo Ancelotti, who had stated that he had not asked the hierarchy to sign Ronaldo.

Nevertheless, that transfer speculation came to an end as Real Madrid had their sole interest in signing Kylian Mbappe from PSG and Florentino Perez had no intention of signing the blockbuster player to add to his squad.

Ever since, Ronaldo wasn't added to the starting line-up in Juventus's opening game of the Serie A season vs Udinese, which left a huge question over his stay at the club.

Juventus seemed quite confident of keeping Ronaldo for yet another season, but the Portuguese had other intentions by the end of the transfer market in which he confirmed his desire to leave. Indirectly, as his agent, Jorge Mendes, kept travelling to Manchester to speak to City officials about a possible transfer for Ronaldo.

As it was widely reported in the media, the Citizens were looking to sign Harry Kane for a potential fee of €150 million, but Daniel Levy had other intentions, which put Manchester City's eyes back on the market in search for a striker.

Cristiano Ronaldo was a man who was keen on a move away from Turin in search of titles as he just wanted to win.

On Friday evening, news emerged that Manchester United stepped in on the pursuit of signing Cristiano Ronaldo from Juventus, and they have certainly sealed his iconic signature and approval to join them this season for 2 years on a contract that runs till 2023.

A statement from United read, "Manchester United is delighted to confirm that the club has reached an agreement with Juventus for the transfer of Cristiano Ronaldo, subject to agreement on personal terms, visa and medical."

Ronaldo began his career at Sporting Lisbon, where his breakthrough came when Manchester United played a club friendly against the Lisbon outfit.

Rio Ferdinand said in a post-match show that he just tore them apart left, right and centre and that was when Sir Alex Ferguson decided that it was about time that United signed the 18-year old teenager who moved to the club for a record-breaking fee for a teenager at that time.

The Portuguese international player left for Real Madrid in 2009 in an €80 million move, which was then a world-record fee, but he is set to wear the jersey of the club where he began his journey to being a global superstar.

Rio Ferdinand confirmed that he had spoken to Cristiano Ronaldo, asking him not to move ahead and play at the Etihad Stadium. Talks between Jorge Mendes, Ronaldo, United and Juventus began on Thursday night, which was not known until Friday morning.

On Friday morning, Ronaldo didn't train with Juventus and he sought to get on his private jet and fly away from the Italian capital. Massimiliano Allegri confirmed in the afternoon that Ronaldo had asked the club to leave before the transfer deadline on August 31st.

## How good is this Signing?

You couldn't write the script for this signing. It is just phenomenal to see the greatest player of our generation return to the Premier League at the age of 36. It just shows how much zeal and passion Ronaldo has under his locker.

Sit back and imagine a 5 time Ballon D'or winner and a 5 time Champions League winner walking into the dressing room with the personality that Cristiano Ronaldo possesses in everything he does on and off the pitch.

Just WOW!

He will definitely raise his standards at Manchester United, who so far seem like a club with a lot of ambitions moving forward this season. He will certainly raise and demand a lot more from his teammates to reach the highest point of their potential as years go by.

At this stage of his career, Ronaldo can just focus on scoring goals rather than thinking a lot about the number of opportunities that would be created to score goals as well as the number of defensive contributions that he had to make, just as he did in Juventus.

## The Benefits of Man United signing Cristiano Ronaldo

1.  **Winning Mentality** - Cristiano Ronaldo is known for his immense character on and off the field, which has made him such a staggering player that is highly recognised all throughout the world.

    The Portuguese will not settle for anything else, but a win. That is the sole purpose of the superstar joining Manchester United because he came to win and he is here to end Manchester United's long trophy drought.

    With the squad that Manchester United have at their disposal, they will be over the moon and they will be uplifted by the prospect of the return of Cristiano Ronaldo to Old Trafford, which should see many more happy days for the fans of the red side of Manchester in terms of goals, victories and, most importantly, trophies.

2.  **Learning** - The likes of Mason Greenwood and a lot of the other youngsters at Manchester United can take great pride in learning from the best that the game of soccer has produced over the years.

    Cristiano Ronaldo is the ultimate guide for these young players as he has himself experienced a lot of highs and lows during his career, but the steel and resolve that he has shown to get past those hurdles is just immaculate.

    Greenwood shouldn't be asking for more as he can learn from the best and be the next best thing at Manchester United in a few years' time.

    We slightly wonder if Ole Gunnar Solskjaer would change his statement and say that "Cristiano Ronaldo" is the best finisher at the club rather than Mason Greenwood. Well, maybe time will tell if OGS makes a statement on that!

3.  **Goals** - Speaking of goals, you don't need to look around for more as Cristiano Ronaldo has scored over 780 official senior goals for both club and country, and the boy from Madeira is just another sensational figure in the world of sports, soccer in particular.

    Goals would be flying in from all directions through Ronaldo, and with the likes of Bruno Fernandes, Mason Greenwood, Paul Pogba, and Jadon Sancho in behind Cristiano at Manchester United, expect Manchester United to be ruthless in front of goal, especially with the assassin-Cristiano Ronaldo in front of goal.

4.  **Marketing and Sales** - The arrival of the Portuguese will just boost a lot of jersey sales for Manchester United in their markets world-wide.

    Manchester United were once a huge force in the global market, but since the departure of Cristiano Ronaldo and a few key players like Wayne Rooney, Rio Ferdinand, and Paul Scholes, the marketing and brand value of Manchester United have dropped to a huge extent.

    But, Cristiano Ronaldo is moving a lot of mountains off the pitch as well, and this is just a good deal for Manchester United to capture and seal with their approval on the arrival of the Portuguese icon.

5.  **Social Media Drive** - The social media handles of Manchester United must be flooded with likes and followers and there is no stop to the continuous increase in likes and followers over the next few days, weeks, and years.
6.  **The Fans** - Man United fans have all the right in the world to set higher ambitions for themselves this season and they will be hoping that their boys in red reach those high standards that Manchester United can attain every season as the club stands for winning and winning trophies.

As always, when a player gets a lot of love and affection from the fans, it just pushes the player to go the extra mile and CR7 is going to benefit a lot from this. In conclusion.....

The Man, the Myth, the Legend, CRISTIANO RONALDO, is at HOME and he is set to be BACK with a BANG!!!

CR7!
