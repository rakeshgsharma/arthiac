## Manchester City player ratings

### 1. Ederson: 5.5

The Brazilian keeper had a quiet day in the office, but he was called into action a few times in the game. He should've probably been penalized for a foul inside the box on Ryan Fraser, but he escaped any sort of punishment.
He made a pretty good save off Wilson's effort on goal.

### 2. Joao Cancelo: 9

The Portuguese right back is in a league of his own as he continued his impressive form in terms of goals
and assists. He did really well to get on the end of a cross to find Ruben Dias for the first goal of
the game. At the same time, for the second goal, he strung a few passes, put Hayden on his back side
and unleashed a beauty in the top left corner. What a goal that was! Grew into the game well and found
a few creative passes through the Newcastle set-up.{' '}

### 3. Aymeric Laporte: 7.5

The Spaniard was so composed throughout the game and he kept Wilson quiet the whole time.

### 4. Ruben Dias: 8

The Portuguese centre-back doesn't really get on the scoresheet often, but he took the gift offered by the hosts and got his goal. He was cool and composed at the back and didn't really get threatened by the Magpies forward line.

### 5. Zinchenko: 7.5

He was making a few attacking runs, but went unnoticed by many. Pulled his trigger and found Mahrez on the run as the Algerian rewarded the Ukrainian with an assist in the game.

### 6. Kevin De Bruyne: 5.5

The Belgian is probably still fighting his way through post Covid as he was rusty and wasn't really fluent in the game. He gave away possession a few times during the game.

### 7. Rodri: 6.5

He kept things nice and simple in midfield and had the license to push forward at times. Gave the ball away on a few occasions, but the hosts didn't make anything out of it.

### 8. Bernardo Silva: 6.5

He wasn't at his brilliant best today, but he was impressive. Got his chance to start this game after a few fitness issues, but he didn't show any signs of it as he did really well to draw a few defenders to him and open up spaces for his teammates.

### 9. Raheem Sterling: 6.5

It was a quiet night for Sterling, but he was always lively and looked to make things happen in the final
third. However, he got his goal with 5 odd minutes to spare.{' '}

### 10. Gabriel Jesus: 6

He made a few good runs and kept the ball well in the first half. However, he would have scored early in the second half after Bernardo Silva laid it on a plate, but Jesus' header on target was brilliantly saved by Dubravka.
Eventually, he got an assist to his name as he found Raheem Sterling at the far post.

### 11. Riyad Mahrez: 7.5

The Algerian was impressive as he kept threatening the hosts from the right hand side. He judged the
lofted cross from Zinchenko really well and slotted it home with ease to give the Citizens their third
goal of the afternoon.{' '}

## Substitutes

### 12. Fernandinho: 6

As usual, the Brazilian came in and kept the clean sheet intact. A walk in the park.

### 13. John Stones: 5

A sightseeing experience for the England international.

### 14. Cole Palmer: 4

Didn't get enough time to make an impression.

## Newcastle United player ratings

### 1. Martin Dubravka: 4.5

He had one of his worst opening 5 minutes of a game as he conceded a silly corner out of which the visitors capitalized on. He should take responsibility for not attempting to rise high and claim the ball.

### 2. Ciaran Clark: 3

If Dubravka's opening 5 minutes were worse, there's no term to describe the awful start that the defender got off to. His decision to leave the ball midway in the air cost his side the opening goal of the game and he should take added responsibility for his horrendous error.
Made a good save early in the second half off Gabriel Jesus. Apart from that, he couldn't do much with the goals that Man City scored.

### 3. Jamaal Lascelles: 4.5

He couldn't really stamp his authority in the heart of the Magpies defense as he struggled to marshall his backline.

### 4. Matt Ritchie: 4

He couldn't really make an impact in the game from the left-hand side as had his work-rate cut-off mostly in the defensive half.

### 5. Jacob Murphy: 5

He was beaten at times, but he worked hard off the ball.

### 6. Isaac Hayden: 4.5

He will be disappointed for losing his footing which gave Cancelo all the time in the world to pick his spot as he also had a tough game to keep the Citizens at bay.
He had a good opportunity to make amends and score off a set-piece, but he couldn't wrap his head around the ball well enough.

### 7. Ryan Fraser: 5.5

He will feel undone by as he wasn't rewarded with a penalty. Worked hard, but it wasn't enough to cause any trouble for Man City.

### 8. Miguel Almiron: 4.5

Yet another player that worked really hard to cause a bit of panic in the Man City backline. He succeeded at times, but the visitors had things under some control.

### 9. Joe Willock: 2

He isn't able to get back to his best form as he did in the back-end of last season. He was clearly off his average best and was extremely poor. He was eventually subbed off at half-time.

### 10. Joelinton: 6

He worked hard and always looked to make it up for his errors in the game.

### 11. Callum Wilson: 5

He was left stranded up front and wasn't able to feed much of the few opportunities that fell his way.

## Substitutes

### 12. Allan Saint-Maximin: 3

He probably needed time to get on his bike, but he couldn't make things happen. Left barren upfront.

### 13. Sean Longstaff: N/A

### 14. Jeff Hendrick: N/A
