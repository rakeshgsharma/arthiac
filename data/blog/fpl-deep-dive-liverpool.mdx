Well, it was about time that we got on a virtual flight to Liverpool. We went across and virtually travelled around England to cover the clubs that are set to compete in the 2021-22 Premier League season, and finally, here we are at Liverpool, where we took a look at their FPL assets.

To sum up Liverpool’s Premier League season in a nutshell, it’s been a mixed season for "The Reds." They were good and promising for a while, only to tail off in between, which made their progression into the final four a much more complicated task.

Liverpool showed what a champion is made of when they hunted Leeds United to a 4-3 victory at Anfield on the opening day of Liverpool’s Premier League campaign. That result was a sign of things to come for "The Reds" as they sent a message across England that they are "Not just done yet."

That 4-3 win against Leeds United was followed by a 2-0 win against Chelsea. The following week, Liverpool took Arsenal down too, with a 3-1 victory over the Gunners.

The 4th of October 2020 will forever remain in the history books as Liverpool were humbled by Aston Villa with a 7-2 scoreline that crumbled the status of Liverpool as 2019-20 Premier League Champions.

Things got worse the following week, as Liverpool drew 2-2 against their rivals Everton. That game also signalled the end of Virgil Van Dijk’s 2021-22 Premier League season as Jordan Pickford came in with a huge tackle at the feet of Virgil Van Dijk. The injury to VVD was just the beginning of Liverpool’s defensive injury woes.

During the course of the season, Liverpool have faced multiple injuries that have dented their progress in the top four.

As the season progressed, Liverpool always found a way to get results on a regular basis. Liverpool put out a statement of real authority when they traveled to Selhurst Park and crushed Crystal Palace 7-0.

In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Liverpool were table toppers after they crumbled Jose Mourinho’s Spurs 3-1 and took down West Ham with the same 3-1 score line. Liverpool were champions by the end of January 2021.

But, things have turned around since the start of February. Liverpool lost four games in a row, which included losses against Brighton and Hove Albion, Manchester City, Leicester City and Everton. These defeats were followed by 1-0 losses against Chelsea and Fulham.

Manchester City kept creeping up the table as they secured victories against their opponents. These damaging defeats meant that Liverpool had to keep up with Manchester City by securing victories that would cement their spot at the top.

Liverpool were not able to get the job done when it mattered the most. By March and April, Liverpool found themselves out of any European competition for the first time in many years.

By the time the season came to an end, Liverpool had to win almost all their games at hand to secure their primary objective, which was the Champions League. From their final 10 games of the season, Liverpool found a way to win 8 out of those 10 games.

Next season, Liverpool will be competing in the Champions League as they narrowly escaped from the jaws of playing in the Europa League.

In this article, we will be looking at Liverpool assets that are worth considering for your FPL teams. As always, we look into every department that "The Reds" have to offer for FPL managers around the world that would want to consider a potential opening for Liverpool asset (s) to enter their teams.

## What to Expect from Liverpool in the FPL?

---

The Reds are expected to go in all guns blazing under the management of Jurgen Klopp.The 2020-21 premier league season was a roller coaster ride for Liverpool fans as their performances midway through the season were disappointing.

Jurgen Klopp plays the German way, which is to press high and put the opposition under immense pressure. Having said that, Liverpool may take some time to find their groove when the season kicks in.

They have the likes of Sadio Mane, Mohammed Salah, Trent Alexander Arnold, Robertson, Jota, and Virgil Van Dijk, who are more than capable of being game changers throughout the course of the season.

Without a doubt, Liverpool will be aiming to be champions of England once again as they look to overcome their counterparts, who are a much tougher competitor than they were in previous seasons, with the likes of Manchester City and Chelsea knocking at their doorstep.

We can expect Liverpool to provide FPL managers with FPL points from each department, especially in attack and defence.

## Players as "Potential" Regular Starters

---

### Goalkeepers

1. **Alisson** - £**6.0m** - We may all know Alisson for his fifth minute stoppage time winner against West Bromwich Albion, which made him the first Liverpool goalkeeper to score a competitive goal.

   Alison is primed and set to be Liverpool's number 1 in between the posts. He is a very commanding and aggressive goalkeeper who cuts down the amount of time the opposition has to pick a spot and score in a 1 on 1 situation.

   As of the 4th of August, 2021, Alisson is found in just **5.3%** of FPL squads worldwide. It is a statistic which can be understood because of the price point that Alison is in the game.

   At £6.0m, he provides decent point returns for the value that he costs. Last season, Alisson made 33 appearances in the Premier League.

   Alisson provided FPL managers with a sum total of **140 FPL points.** On an average, Alison provided **4.24 FPL points per game.**

   If you look into it, his return of guaranteeing 4.24 FPL points is not a bad statistic to consider if you decide to invest in the Brazilian goalkeeper.

   Liverpool have been considering a lot of goals lately, especially in the friendlies, which was a usual habit even in the 2020-21 Premier League season. When a team concedes a goal, it reduces the goalkeepers' points by 4 since they lost out on the clean sheet. Yet, Alison has been pretty consistent with the number of points he provides.

   If you had him in the game against West Bromwich Albion, you must have enjoyed the FPL points that the goalkeeper had provided.

   His goal against West Bromwich Albion goes to show that he is a determined goalkeeper who is willing to put in the hard yards both defensively as well as from an attacking perspective whenever the opportunity comes by.

   **Is he Worth the Investment?**

   At **£6.0m**, Alison faces competition from the likes of Mendy and Ederson from Chelsea and Manchester City respectively. It is fair to say that Chelsea and Manchester City have a much better defensive set-up than Liverpool based on what we have seen during the course of the previous season as well as the friendlies.

   You may want to have Alison in goal at £6m as a guaranteed starter from Liverpool, but he may be a bit too expensive at **£6.0m** as you would not want to spend around **£10.0m** on goalkeepers only.

   **Our Opinion?**

   We have taken a look at Liverpool's opening fixtures. As FPL managers, it is important that we get off to a good start. In the opening 6 fixtures for Liverpool, Alisson has huge potential to provide clean sheets as well as save points. Besides the game against Chelsea in game week 3, Alisson could be a really good option as a goalkeeper, especially with the return of Virgil Van Dijk and Konate at centre-back.

   If Liverpool show that they are defensively well-set up, then an investment in Alisson will be worth it!

### Defenders

1. **Alexander-Arnold** **(TAA)** - **Right-back** - £**7.5m** - Trent Alexander-Arnold will be hugely disappointed at missing out on the England squad for the 2020 Euros through injury. However, his injury presented a much better opportunity for FPL managers to consider Trent Alexander-Arnold in their FPL squads since he is fresh and ready to go.

   Last season, he was also out for a while due to Covid-19.

   He is currently priced at **£7.5m** where he currently sits at **28.1%** of FPL squads worldwide.

   Jurgen Klopp has admitted that it took time for Trent Alexander Arnold to find his groove back after being contacted by covid-19. However, throughout the season, Trent has made telling contributions that helped Liverpool get through the finish line. One notable contribution was his goal against Aston Villa that secured 3 points for Liverpool.

   In the 2020-21 Premier league season, Trent Alexander-Arnold has made many defensive contributions. This has been a revelation in his game, as many suggest that he is an attacking full-back. He is still considered as an attacking full back, but when Liverpool needed defensive contributions, he was there when it mattered.

   Last season, Trent Alexander-Arnold provided a sum total of **160 FPL points** to those FPL managers who owned him.

   He made a total of 36 appearances in the Premier League last season. On an average, Trent Alexander-Arnold has provided a total of **4.44 FPL points per game.** There were many games in which Liverpool conceded more than two goals, which resulted in an additional point subtracted from Trent Alexander-Arnold.

   Even though Liverpool had a troublesome defensive campaign in the 2020-21 Premier League season, Trent Alexander Arnold still provided FPL managers with multiple points throughout the course of the season.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   Even when he is priced at **£7.5m**, Trent Alexander-Arnold has the potential to provide huge FPL points for FPL managers and he could be the right candidate to be in your defensive line-up that provides FPL points, especially in Liverpool's opening 6 fixtures.

   Liverpool depend a lot on his deliveries from the right hand side, and if Salah, Mane and Firmino get them, Trent Alexander-Arnold will be a huge FPL asset.

   Last season, TAA created a total of **77 chances,** out of which he was rewarded with only **7 assists** (disappointing for Liverpool’s attackers as they did not take the chances on offer). Furthermore, Liverpool kept a total of **10 clean sheets**.

   Adding to that, TAA has had 55 goal attempts in the 2020-21 Premier League season, which is the highest by a Premier League defender. At the same time, he is on set-piece duty, such as corners and indirect free-kicks.

   Those statistics are just a good indicator that he is **worth every pound** in FPL.

   Here are his stats for Liverpool:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2016-17 | 7       | 0     | 0       |
   | 2017-18 | 19      | 1     | 1       |
   | 2018-19 | 29      | 1     | 12      |
   | 2019-20 | 38      | 4     | 13      |
   | 2020-21 | 36      | 2     | 7       |

   **Our Opinion?**

   Liverpool have not got off to a great start **defensively** in the last few Premier League campaigns. However, if you are investing in the TAA, then we recommend you invest in him, especially because of his attacking points potential.

   According to us, TAA is worth an investment as he provides FPL points that are **more** or **equivalent** to FPL midfielders who are priced at the same range.

2. **Robertson** - **Leftback** - £**7.0m** - Andrew Robertson has been Liverpool's most consistent player over the course of the last 3-4 Premier League seasons. Last season, he made 38 appearances for the club.

   **At £7.0m,** Andrew Robertson provides really good FPL value for the amount of FPL points that he delivers constantly. He is the go-to man for Jurgen Klopp at left back.

   Andrew Robertson provides a much cheaper alternative to TAA and he currently sits at **13.4%** of FPL squads worldwide. In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Andrew Robertson has provided a sum total of **161 FPL points** in 38 Premier League appearances.

   On an average, this records **4.23 FPL points per game.**

   Once again, Andrew Robertson's FPL points have not escalated just as TAA as Liverpool have had multiple defensive injury woes that have prevented their full-backs from advancing forward from the wings.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   Andrew Robertson is definitely worth the investment at **£7.0m**. There are many midfielders in the FPL who are not regular starters for their respective clubs. At the same time, Andrew Robertson provides returns that are more or equivalent to a midfielder in the game. Consequently, Andrew Robertson is on set piece duty along with Trent Alexander-Arnold. This additional responsibility of being on set pieces provides Andrew Robertson with a potential opportunity to get more FPL points, especially with the return of VVD and the recent signing of Konate.

   Robertson has created a total of **66 chances** throughout the course of the Premier League campaign, where he has been rewarded with **7 assists**. Consequently, his **goal attempts** are relatively low that TAA which sums up to **19**. Robertson has kept **12 clean sheets** for Liverpool. He is also on **set-piece duty,** which Liverpool have not converted much from. Here are his stats at Liverpool:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2017-18 | 22      | 1     | 5       |
   | 2018-19 | 36      | 0     | 11      |
   | 2019-20 | 36      | 2     | 12      |
   | 2020-21 | 38      | 1     | 7       |

   **Our Opinion?**
   TAA provides many more attacking returns than Roberston. But, if you find it difficult to fit an extra £0.5m for Trent Alexander Arnold, then an investment in Robertson is not a bad shout.

   If you don’t feel convinced by the likes of Robertson in your team, then avoid him. There are a few midfielders that you may consider in your FPL teams, such as Saka (£6.5m), Raphinha (£6.5m), Buendia (£6.5m), Bertrand Traore (£6.0m) and a few more.

3. **Virgil Van Dijk (VVD)** - **Centre-back** - £**6.5m** - VVD’s minutes on the pitch may be equally balanced this season as he has just returned from his knee injury which he sustained against Everton in the 2020-21 campaign.

   In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Virgil Van Dijk has made just 5 appearances. Even in those 5 appearances, he has scored a goal for himself.

   This goes to show that Virgil Van Dijk provides a really good FPL option at £6.5m to provide decent and reliable FPL returns irrespective of the number of minutes he plays this season.

   He is a real threat in the air in setpieces. His huge figure in the attacking and defensive box will be crucial for Liverpool and this will also provide FPL managers with FPL points. If Liverpool keep a clean sheet, Virgil Van Dijk is a prime candidate to get a few bonus points as well.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   No. we do not believe that Virgil Van Dijk is an investment that FPL managers should make. This is because he has just returned from injury and Jurgen Klopp considers him one of the untouchables at the club. Liverpool depend highly on the services of their Dutch centre back. It is impossible to see Jurgen Klopp taking the risk of making Virgil Van Dijk start regularly every game as his fitness will be tested.

   Virgil Van Dijk has been out for nearly more than a year and his legs might be weary at the start of the Premier League season. Here are his stats:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2017-18 | 14      | 0     | 0       |
   | 2018-19 | 38      | 4     | 2       |
   | 2019-20 | 38      | 5     | 1       |
   | 2020-21 | 5       | 1     | 0       |

   **Our Opinion?**
   If VVD finds full fitness immediately at the start of the season, then you have multiple benefits.

   - His return will make TAA and Robertson much more attractive.

   - If FPL managers don’t have the funds for TAA and Robertson, an investment in VVD will provide FPL managers with clean sheets, goals at varied intervals and bonus points.

4. **Konate** - **Centre-back - £5.5m** - Konate, who was a £36 million summer signing from RB Leipzig, has been training under Jurgen Klopp and his coaching staff for the first time.

   His signing will add much needed defensive stability to Liverpool’s backline. He is quick and aggressive as a centre-back. At the same time, he is pretty good at getting in for last-ditch tackles.

   The centre-back is currently forming a centre-back partnership with Joel Matip in Liverpool’s friendlies. Given that Joel Matip has had a load of injury concerns in the past. It is hard to see him play regularly.

   Our pick is that the French centre-back is going to be crucial for Liverpool and start as many games as possible.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   We cannot say for sure if he is worth the investment or not. There are many £5.5m defenders up for grabs with the likes of Luke Shaw, Digne, Rudiger, Castagne, Stones, Maguire and Cresswell.

   **Our Opinion?**

   He may be rotated regularly, but if he gets a good run of games, he is in for some FPL points. Watch out for the number of starts he is provided with by Jurgen Klopp.

### Midfielders

1. **Salah** - £**12.5m** - Mohamed Salah has been another Liverpool player that has constantly been providing goals and assists for his side. Ever since he joined Liverpool in the 2017 18 premier league season, he has been phenomenal in front of goal, providing FPL managers and Liverpool fans with a lot of joy and satisfaction.

   This season, he has continued to be a superstar at the club. His goal and assist numbers for Liverpool speak for themselves, and the Egyptian king is set to raise the bar in the 2021-22 Premier League season.

   The Egyptian king is one of the premium assets that FPL has to offer to FPL managers this season. Salah is priced at 12.5 million and is currently chosen by **48.6%** of FPL managers.

   When an FPL manager invests in Salah, there are a lot of expectations on the Egyptian King to deliver regularly week in and week out. Mohammad Salah has not disappointed over the course of the last three or four seasons as he has continuously delivered goals, assists and FPL points for his owners.

   An interesting aspect of Mohammed Salah’s game is that he is able to take multiple positions on the pitch and still score goals. Speaking of goals, he is exemplary in his finishing abilities as he scores a lot of goals season after season.

   In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Salah has been struggling to find the net on many occasions. Salah has found himself many times where he was 1-on-1 with the goalkeeper. Unfortunately, he found it difficult to seal the deal in front of goal.

   But, we expect him to be at the fore-front of Liverpool’s attack this coming season as well. An additional benefit that Salah has in his locker is that he is on penalties and he usually finds the net more often than not.

   **Is it worth the investment?**

   It is very hard to imagine an FPL team without premium assets. Mohammad Salah is a premium asset that every manager should look to invest in. He is an FPL asset that you cannot avoid when you start building your FPL squad.

   Salah is guaranteed to have another season where he will provide FPL points week after week. In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Salah has made 37 Premier League appearances in which he has scored a total of **22 goals** and supplied **5 assists** for his teammates.

   In FPL terms, Salah has scored a total of **231 FPL points** in 37 Premier League appearances. On an average, he provides **6.24 points per game,** which is **equivalent** to him **assisting once every game.**

   If you look at it, those returns are definitely worth investing in. Here are his stats for Liverpool:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2017-18 | 36      | 32    | 10      |
   | 2018-19 | 38      | 22    | 8       |
   | 2019-20 | 34      | 19    | 10      |
   | 2020-21 | 37      | 22    | 5       |

   **Our Opinion?**

   Get. Him. In! You will get "consistency" from the Egyptian King.

2. **Mane** - £**12.0m** - Sadio Mane has also been handed a premium price tag at £12.0m. Sadio Mane had a Premier League season that was slightly disappointing when you look deeply into it. The 2020-21 season has not been exceptional for Mane.

   But, he still managed to provide goals, assists and FPL points. When Salah was struggling in front of the goal, it was Mane who stood up and provided goals and assists for "The Reds."

   Mane is an FPL asset that not many of the FPL managers will want to look at. He is mostly ignored by many FPL managers as he is not on set-piece duty or even penalties. For a player that costs £12.0m, you look for other potential opportunities that they could score goals from, such as free-kicks or penalties. But, this is not the case for Sadio Mane.

   However, he is priced at £12.0m.

   His numbers are decent but not very convincing, according to us. In the 2020-21 Premier League season, Mane made 35 Premier League appearances where he scored a total of 11 goals and provided a further 7 assists.

   In the FPL last season, he recorded a total of 176 points. On average, he provided a total of **5.02 points per game.** It is a decent stat for managers to consider

   However, the reality is that FPL managers prefer to go with the likes of Bruno Fernandes (£12.5m), Kevin De Bruyne (£12.0m) and his teammate Salah (£12.5m) in midfield.

   The other scenario is when FPL managers look to invest £11-12.0m in a forward such as Kane (£12.5m). Here are his stats for Liverpool:

   | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
   | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
   | 2016-17 | 27      | 13    | 5       |
   | 2017-18 | 29      | 10    | 7       |
   | 2018-19 | 36      | 22    | 1       |
   | 2019-20 | 35      | 18    | 7       |
   | 2020-21 | 35      | 11    | 7       |

   **Our Opinion?**

   If you are brave and bold as an FPL manager, we won’t put you off signing him at the **start of the Premier League season**.

   He is capable of having an outstanding season this campaign and the Liverpool fans cannot wait to see him go in full flow.

   Adding to that, Sadio Mane is actually having a really good pre-season. Yes, these pre-season games might not mean much. But, they contribute a lot to a player’s overall plan in preparing for a whole season

   At the same time, Mane scores goals when he is in form. It’ll be good to know if you caught that bus!

3. **Jota** - £**7.5m** - Diogo Jota has made a debatable, electrifying start to his Liverpool career in the 2020-21 season. When Mane and Salah have been on the downside of scoring goals, Jota has actually come into the spotlight and scored goals.

   At **£7.5m**, he is a really attractive option to be considered in your midfield line up, especially if Firmino, Salah and Mane pick up injuries.

   We expect Jota to get much more game time this season, provided that he is fit and free from injuries. He is one of the go-to players for Jurgen Klopp.

   Additionally, last season, Diogo Jota gave a lot of decision-making problems to his manager towards the back-end of last season as he was on another level when it came to scoring goals regularly.

   However, Diogo Jota has not been prolific for Portugal recently in the Euros. He has been off-target of late and got a close-range goal thanks to a Cristiano Ronaldo assist.

   **Is he worth the investment?**

   There have been times when Jurgen Klopp decided to go with a **front 4** last season which was a tactic he used against Manchester City. The front 4 consisted of Salah, Firmino, Mane and Jota.

   If those front 4 click, it will be very hard to avoid Jota in your FPL teams. Jota takes up Firmino’s position more often than not. Jota looks to get into more goal-scoring positions than Firmino does.

   You could say that Jota is a predator in the box, whereas Firmino looks to create opportunities for Salah and Mane upfront along with Jota.

   He is definitely worth the investment if Salah, Firmino or Mane are out injured.

   **Our Opinion?**

   Wait and watch for the amount of minutes he plays this season. Watch out for the Liverpool injury list too, especially in attack.

   Look out for his form. Once he hits form, he will be nearly impossible to ignore.

   A head start, Jurgen Klopp has mentioned that players who have been longer with their national teams will get additional rest and time to recover before they get back into action.

   Firmino had been with the Brazilian team for the Copa America until the final. Whereas Jota was eliminated from the tournament much sooner.

   This gives a good thought for FPL managers to consider, especially at the **start of the campaign** where J**ota might be selected to start.**

### Forwards

1. **Firmino** - £**9.0m** - When it comes to the Brazilian striker, Liverpool fans will know that he is more of a creator rather than a constant goal scorer under Jurgen Klopp.

   As a striker, you want to score goals on a regular basis. But, the role that Firmino has subscribed to for Liverpool is worth taking a look at.

   However, his overall numbers cannot be ignored. In the 2020-21 Premier League season, he made a total of 36 Premier League appearances in which he scored a total of **9 goals** and provided **7 assists** in that season.

   In FPL terms, he scored a total of **141 FPL points**. If you look at his average points per game, he provided FPL managers with **3.91 points per game.**

   Generally, you wouldn’t mind the fact that he provides nearly 4 points per game if you have him on your FPL team.

   Having said that, the downside of having Firmino in your team is that you have other forwards at a much cheaper price range that deliver more points on an average. **Watkins (£7.5m)**, **Bamford (£8.0m)**, **Kane (£12.5m)**, **Vardy (£10.5m)**, **Calvert-Lewin (£8.0m)**, **Wilson (£7.5)** and **Ings (£8.0m)** provide much more than Firmino. We’ll break it down for you.

   | Name          | Appearances | FPL Points | Average points per game |
   | ------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----------------------- |
   | Kane          | 35          | 242        | 6.91                    |
   | Bamford       | 38          | 194        | 5.10                    |
   | Vardy         | 34          | 187        | 5.50                    |
   | Watkins       | 37          | 168        | 4.50                    |
   | Calvert-Lewin | 33          | 165        | 5.00                    |
   | Wilson        | 26          | 134        | 5.15                    |
   | Ings          | 29          | 131        | 4.51                    |

   <small className="flex justify-center xx-small">
     {' '}
     Above stats are based on the 2020-21 PL season
   </small>

   As you can see in the stats above, there are many more cheaper alternatives than Firmino that FPL managers can invest in.

   **Our Opinion?**

   He will be worth the investment during the months of December and January. Historically, he has constantly hit top-notch form during those two months.

   If you can, get him in during those months. We hope we will hit peak form during the whole season as well.
