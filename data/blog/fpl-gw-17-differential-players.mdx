### 1. De Gea: £5.1m

Man Utd's Spaniard keeper is within the mix to be a good differential pick for a goalkeeper this week. He is owned by **8.7%** of FPL managers in the game and his impressive form off late will draw managers to invest a few FPL pounds on him.

In GW16 against Norwich City, De Gea was sensational in between the sticks making a number of huge saves and punches during the game to keep his side in the game for long periods.

Eventually, he scored **10 points** as he made **5 saves**, kept a **clean sheet** and got all **3 bonus points**. He was kept busy in between the sticks, but he did what he had to do.

This season, De Gea played all **16 Premier League games** and kept **4 clean sheets** in total making a total of **44 saves** so far this season. Adding to that, he has made **2 penalty saves** as well.

In GW15 and GW16, he has scored 6 and 10 points respectively. If you invest in him, he is one to hold for the long term as **10** of his next **11** gameweeks are one to cash in on.

**Eye Test**: The Spaniard is one of Man Utd's best players on the field. He is one of the few sole reasons why the Red Devils have been gaining points this season.

He is slowly gaining popularity in many FPL teams and his differential status will be coming to an end soon.

Note: There are reports circling around that Man Utd's training center has been closed following a covid outbreak within the club as members of their staff and players were tested positive.

There is no assurity whether the squad will travel to London or not so far.

### 2. Ait Nouri: £4.3m

Wolves' left-back is one huge differential this week as they take on Brighton away from home at the Amex in GW17.

This season, the left back has been getting few opportunities to prove his worth, but lately, he's been able to put in a convincing performance that certainly raised the eyebrows of his manager. His top notch performance against Liverpool a few days ago set the benchmark for Bruno Lage and FPL managers to consider.

The French left-back is owned by just **1.0%** of FPL managers currently. His value is impressive. Since GW12, he's been consistently providing points apart from last week. A consistent run of clean sheets and attacking prowess and lifted his chances of starting week in and week out in the Premier League.

Here are his stats: Premier League

**Games played**: 9

**Assists**: 1

**Clean Sheets**: 5

**Goals Conceded**: 4

Wolves currently sit in 9th position in the League table where they have won 6, drawn thrice and lost 7 times. They are a side who keep it tight and compact at the back which has been the story so far for Wolves this season.

Eye Test: Ait Nouri provides an attacking threat from the left-hand side as well, but his teammates up front are currently struggling to find the net on a regular basis, which indirectly affects their wing-backs.

In case you decide to go for him, it will mostly be only for a clean sheet.

### 3. Foden: £8.0m

The Man City youngster is certainly one bright FPL prospect this season. Even though he belongs to a side that is managed by Pep, he is still a very attractive option to consider. If he gets going, there's no stopping him.

This season, Foden has played 10 games and scored **49 points**. He's got **3 goals** and **3 assists** to his name.

He was in fine form before injury hit him, but with him getting a few minutes against Wolves at the weekend as a substitute, he is guaranteed to be in the starting XI this week when they take on Leeds at home.

Foden is currently owned by just **5.8%** of FPL managers worldwide. He is definitely a good shout for a captaincy spot this week as he takes on a Leeds side who are without the likes of Kalvin Phillips for 2 months. That line just spoke for itself. Didn't it?

The youngster can really come in hot this mid-week as he has all the attributes to cause havoc within that Leeds defensive line. Adding to that, Man City's fixtures moving forward are tasty on the charts as they face Newcastle, Leicester City and Brentford in their next 3 Premier League games after their home encounter with Leeds.

**Eye Test**: If you've got doubts, take a look at his goal against Liverpool. He's always lively in and around the box.

### 4. Ings: £7.7m

The English striker has been hit by a hamstring injury in recent weeks, but he has made a substitute appearance last week and he is set and ready to go in against Norwich in gameweek 17. The former Liverpool and Saints man got his season underway in fine fashion as he was raking up FPL points consistently, but he is prone to injuries.

However, Danny Ings will be in contention for a starting spot against Norwich and **we reckon** that he will be in the starting XI against the Canaries. Norwich have improved defensively and with Steven Gerrard losing at the weekend against Liverpool, he will want to make an impact in their next game and take the club higher.

In order to do that, he will require the services of Danny Ings.

In terms of numbers, Danny Ings has played **11** Premier League games so far this season and scored a total of **42 FPL points**. He's got **3 goals** and **2 assists** under his belt. To add to that, he's also got penalties under his locker as well. These boost his overall claim in this week's differential asset on your side.

He's also got Burnley after the game against Norwich where the possibility of FPL points increases further.

With his ownership sitting at just **7.7%**, you could get a lot of green arrows this week and in GW18 as well in case you spend a few FPL pounds on the striker.

**Eye Test**: Danny Ings is a player who will pop up at the right place and at the right time. He links up well with his teammates too.

He is sure to give Norwich a good run for their money.
