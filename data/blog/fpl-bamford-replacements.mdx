With just under 15 hours to go until the deadline for GW6, FPL managers around the world are rushing to get their transfers in before the price hike in an FPL forward asset.

Patrick Bamford (£8.0m) sustained an ankle injury in GW5 against Newcastle United, as he did not take any part in their midweek EFL Cup tie against Fulham.

Marcelo Bielsa's side has a number of injury concerns, with Bamford (£8.0m), Llorente (£4.5m), and Koch (£4.4m) all ruled out for the game against West Ham United at Elland Road.

Consequently, he has to possibly cope without the likes of Ayling (£4.5m), Raphinha (£6.5m) and Jack Harrison (£5.8m) at home against the Hammers.

With time running out and with limited funds available, we look at the budget gems you could invest in your FPL sides for GW6.

1.  Saint-Maximin: (£6.7m) - The Frenchman currently sits in 13% of FPL squads for now and the forward has been extremely important to Steve Bruce and his side as the Magpies cope without their talisman, Wilson (£7.4m), but things have been bright on the other end as you could have Saint-Maximin as a much cheaper alternative.

    The injury to Wilson has given the Frenchman much more freedom while he is on the attack. There is "spice and everything nice" when it comes to ASM. He has been clinical for the Magpies as there is no stopping him when he is in full flow.

    In GW4, against Manchester United, a cheeky assist set up Javier Manquillo (£4.0m) to lash one into the net and he capitalised on the opportunity provided.

    The following week, in GW5, Allan Saint-Maximin just ran his own show at St. James' Park as he dribbled past the Leeds defensive line with ease, picked his spot and buried it into the net past Meslier's (£5.0m) right. Consequently, the French forward picked up 2 bonus points as well.

    Speaking of stats,

    - So far, Saint-Maximin has blanked in just 1 gameweek so far.

    - I scored 8 FPL points in GW5.

    - He has a total of 27 FPL points so far this season.

    - He has registered 5.4 FPL points on an average so far this season.

    - In total, he has 4 bonus points to his name as well.

    - That is a stat worth considering as the Magpies don't have a lot of flair in their squad and yet ASM keeps delivering for his managers.

    With Newcastle not featuring in the midweek EFL Cup game, ASM will be fully fresh and ready to rumble (with the ball) on Saturday against Watford. Everything he touches leads to something exciting. He just gets you on your toes every single time he has the ball at his feet.

    Newcastle's next 4 fixtures are:

    - Watford - 25 September, 2021
    - Wolves - 2 October, 2021
    - Spurs - 17 October, 2021
    - Crystal Palace - 23 October, 2021

    These sides have not been solid at the back in the opening game weeks of the 2021-22 Premier League season and with Saint-Maximin's drive, agility and pace, he is set to cause havoc for opposition defenders provided that he stays fit (Which he is).

    With Watford up next, Steve Bruce can really utilise his star man to wreck a lot of damage on Watford and the man himself will be licking his lips to get on the scoresheet. That calls for a lot of FPL points as well in case you invest in ASM.

2.  Michail Antonio: (£7.9m) - The Jamaican forward currently sits in nearly 38% of FPL squads so far and he has been in stellar form this season as he has ripped out opposition defences with his energy and gaile when he thrusts forward with zeal.

    Apart from receiving his red card against Southampton in GW4, Antonio has registered numbers that hit the roof. He's got his own Jedi as he has hit the ground running as he is out there challenging the premium FPL forwards and midfielders for the Golden boot.

    In FPL terms, Antonio has been a revelation for many FPL managers as he started the campaign with a price point at £7.5m and quickly hit the £7.9m, 8.0m mark.

    Speaking of stats,

    - In 4 games played so far, Antonio has blanked in just 1.

    - He has registered a total of 39 FPL points so far this season.

    - On an average, he has registered 9.75 FPL points per game.

    - Those numbers speak for themselves.

    So far, in 4 game weeks this season, he has registered 3 double digit hauls in which he has scored 13, 16 and 11 FPL points respectively.

    The man is on fire and he's got an added spring in his boots as he will aim to keep his discipline in check and be ruthless when the opportunity comes by in front of goal.

    West Ham's next 5 fixtures are:

    - Leeds - 25 September, 2021
    - Brentford - 3 October, 2021
    - Everton - 17 October, 2021
    - Spurs - 24 October, 2021
    - Aston Villa - 31 October, 2021

    Those are really tasty fixtures if you are the owner of Antonio. Those are games in which Antonio will set out rolling his sleeves to get on the scoresheet. Once again, that calls for many more FPL points on the horizon up for grabs.

3.  Rodrigo: (£6.3m) - The Spanish forward currently sits in just 1% of FPL squads for now, but BOY! What a gem he could be!

    The Spaniard has not had a great start to the Premier League season, as he has had to rely on the strengths of Bamford (who is not available in GW6).

    So far, Rodrigo has registered just 4 points in this season's Fantasy Premier League campaign as he is slightly off colour. Although he deserves a lot of credit for Leeds' goal against Newcastle at St. James' Park as he let the ball through his legs from a wicked cross from Raphinha from the right-hand side of Leeds' attack. You could give him a cheeky cute fantasy assist for that. Couldn't you?

    Creepy jokes aside, he has always been a team player and right now, as Patrick Bamford is out with an ankle injury, Marcelo Bielsa will be highly dependent on his Spanish striker to deliver the goods up front for the Yorkshire club and get them up and running.

    However, he will require a decent amount of supply from the wings to make an impact. With Daniel James (£6.0m) available, Bielsa would have to turn to his bench for some attacking prowess in case he doesn't have the luxury he requires.

    But, we could tell that Raphinha, Jack Harrison and Luke Ayling will play in this game as Bielsa will do anything to keep the Brazilian fit and ready as the coach is desperate to get points on the board.

4.  Hwang: (£5.5m) - The South-Korean forward could be such a colossal differential in your FPL squads in case you decide to take the punt and go with him. Although he is not a guaranteed starter for Bruno Lage.

    However, the Wolves boss may have to reconsider keeping the South-Korean on the bench as he has just been all about pace, finesse and accuracy.

    They nicknamed him "Bull." He certainly deserves that nickname.

    Hwang has just made 2 appearances in the Premier League so far this season, and every time he is on the ball, he gives 110% on the field.

    In his debut against Watford in gameweek 4, the South-Korean scored a goal and claimed all 3 bonus points as well as he found the back of the net with ease and sealed all 3 points for Wolves.

    Hwang currently sits in 2.3% of FPL squads. It seems like your colleagues in the FPL world actually bank on Hwang Hee-Chan to deliver. Are you one of those?
