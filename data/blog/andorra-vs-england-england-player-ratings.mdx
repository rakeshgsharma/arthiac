England cruised past minnows Andorra as they are one step closer to the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.

The hosts, Andorra, couldn't really threaten England on Saturday night even as fires broke out in the stadium a day before which threatened the fulfilment of the fixture.

Gareth Southgate and his men rose to the occasion as they put 5 past a defensive Andorran side with Ben Chilwell, Bukayo Saka, Tammy Abraham, James Ward-Prowse and Jack Grealish getting on the scorecard.

English fans will be ecstatic to see some of their fringe players get on the field and demonstrate what they can bring to this extremely talented England team.

## England player ratings

1.  **Sam Johnstone: 8** - He had a good comfortable outing in goal against Andorra and he was not being put to the test at all during the game.

    However, he got an assist from a quick long throw and made a save late on in the game even though the offside flag was up.

2.  **Kieran Trippier: 7** - He was the most experienced member of the starting XI, and he led the team to a clean sheet and all three points.
3.  **John Stones: 6.5** - did well defensively as he wasn't really shaken by what Andorra had to offer. He got booked in the game for a silly confrontation with an Andorran player.
4.  **Conor Coady: 7** - Played well and swept up any wandering ball across the field and built up England's play from the back. He looks comfortable in the English set-up.
5.  **Ben Chilwell: 8.5** - It was a day for the Chelsea man, where you could probably"Netflix and Chill-well" as the left-back had a lot of talking with the ball at his feet on the left-hand side of England's attack.

    He will be super duper happy to get his first international goal for England.

6.  **Jesse Lingard: 7.5** - The Man Utd midfielder was looking for solutions every now and then, bursting down the wings regularly looking to find a teammate.

    He did well and still has a lot to offer in the Three Lions jersey.

7.  **James Ward-Prowse: 7** - As always, the Southampton midfielder is always a threat from set-pieces.

    He missed a penalty, but he was quick to react and fire the rebound home.

8.  **Phil Foden: 9** - The Man City wonderkid is a delight to watch. Found his teammates really well from one end of the field to another through his outrageous diagonal balls.

    Provided an assist for Bukayo Saka's goal and created a lot of opportunities as well.

9.  **Bukayo Saka: 8.5** - This youngster was so good with the ball at his feet as he gave the Andorran defenders a real nightmare down the flanks.

    He took his goal really well as he drilled it sweetly beyond the goalkeeper's reach.

10. **Tammy Abraham: 7.5** - The Roma striker got a much-needed goal that will boost his confidence as he was alive and alert to the situation at hand.

11. **Jadon Sancho: 7.5** - He did provide two assists in the game. He will be thrilled that he is able to make the most out of his opportunity in the Three Lions jersey after Southgate had stated that he was lucky to be in the England squad after his recent performances in a Man Utd jersey.

    He set it up really well for Chilwell, who scored his debut England goal and provided a really good cross for Tammy Abraham as well.

    Yet another player who was a nightmare for Andorra.

## Substitutes

12. **Fikayo Tomori: 6** - He came on as a substitute and kept things quiet and easy at the back. There was not much he had to deal with.

13. **Mason Mount: 6** - He came on and provided much more stability and attacking threat for the Andorrans to take into account.

14. **Jack Grealish: 8** - His introduction was a breath of fresh air in England's attack as his driving run earned a penalty for the Three Lions and he scored a fantastic goal which was one of the headlines of the night.

15. **Ollie Watkins: 5** - He came on and tried to make an impact, but was shut down by the Andorran defence.
