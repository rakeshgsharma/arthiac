The Premier League is due to arrive on your screens on the 13th of August, 2021, which is exactly three weeks from now as Arsenal travel to Brentford in the opening fixture of the 2021-22 Premier League Season.

Through the years, the Premier League has provided fans and devout followers of the game and their clubs with chills, thrills, emotions and grief. Through it all, there are rainbows that fans yearn for, such as the return of Leeds United to the Premier League last season.

Arsenal are today’s prime area of focus where we will look into every department that the Gunners have to offer to FPL managers around the world that have a potential opening for an Arsenal asset(s) to enter their teams.

In this article, we will take a look at Arsenal’s guaranteed/potential key players, starters, and player potential.

## Arsenal in 2020-21

---

Arsenal finished their season on 8th after a trouble-some start to their Premier League campaign. Arsenal’s former captain, Mikel Arteta, had been appointed as Arsenal head coach on a three-and-a -half-year deal. He joined Arsenal after spending over three years on the right-hand side of Pep Guardiola. Results seemed hard to come by as Arsenal missed out on a place in a European competition for the first time since the 1995-96 campaign, which lasted for over two decades.

With no European football this season, the Gunners are expected to perform well above their usual standards in the upcoming season. The pressure is on Mikel Arteta to deliver. Only time will tell and the results will speak.

The likes of Aubameyang, Nicolas Pepe, Willian, and Kieran Tierney have not delivered throughout the course of the Premier League season on a continuous basis. Arsenal overall have been below par in the 2020-21 season with a few notable positive results, as they got over Manchester United in a 1-0 win in Manchester, along with an impressive 3-1 victory against Chelsea.

## What to Expect from Arsenal in the FPL?

---

The disappointment of not securing a European spot for the 2021-22 season might provide Arsenal with a very good opportunity to have an impressive season under the guidance of Mikel Arteta. Most importantly, this gives us FPL managers the chance to sort out an Arsenal asset into our FPL teams.

With no European football, players have the opportunity to gain added rest. This added rest provides players with re-charged batteries and increased adrenaline, which helps them to remain fresh and ready to rumble come game day.

## Players as Potential “Regular” Starters

---

### Goalkeeper

- **Bernd Leno – 5.0m**

  In FPL terms, Leno was Arsenal’s top point scorer (tied with Aubameyang). This point stat is very impressive, especially for a goalkeeper. It has also demonstrated Arsenal’s reliance on Leno to pull out saves when it matters the most. As many of the FPL managers may know, more saves = save points with a slight chance of bonus points as well.

  Leno had pulled out 87 saves during the 2020-21 season in which he started 35 out of the 38 games played where he rewarded his previous owners with 11 clean sheets.

  If you are looking for a goalkeeper that provides "Save Points" and "Regular Starts" from the Gunners side, then Bernd Leno is the man you need to pick.

### Defenders

- **Tierney** – **Left-back** – **5.0m**

  Tierney is Arteta’s go-to man at left-back. He is arguably the best defensive and attacking asset that Arsenal have in their defence. Keiran Tierney was Arsenal’s top defender as he had 15 "Attempts on Goal" last season. (Tied with Bellerin, who is set to leave the club.)

  Tierney provides a lot of attacking threat on the left-hand side when Arsenal attack in full swing. He has the desired calibre to carry the ball forward in threatening situations to provide an assist or score a goal himself. For me, he is one to look out for as an FPL asset.

- **Gabriel** – **Centre-back** – **5.0m**

  Arsenal’s Left-footed Centre-back scored on his debut against Fulham at Craven Cottage. A bright start to his career at the Emirates was halted due to injury and lack of match fitness.

  Yet, the Brazilian centre-back has scored 2 goals in the 2020-21 season where he played 90 minutes for most of the games that he started.

  Gabriel does carry a card or two with him in his locker, as he saw his first red-card in an Arsenal shirt in the 1-1 draw with Southampton.

- **Holding** – **Centre-back** – **4.5m**

  Based on 4.5m this season, Rob Holding provides a reasonable option for FPL managers to consider as a cheap defender into their 5-man defence line. He was also Arsenal’s highest scoring defender at 4.5m last season as well.

  Holding started 30 out of the 38 games played where he provided an assist too. His attacking numbers are not one to look at. With 4.5m defenders, it is mostly the case of a player’s ability to provide a defensive performance.

  In that case, Rob Holding’s defensive numbers are worth looking at. As a tall figure in Arsenal’s back line, Holding has won over 70 aerial duels and he was also Arsenal’s best when it came to tackles.

- **Chambers** – **Right-back** – **4.5m**

  An injury-prone career for Calum Chambers has halted his progress as a player for many years. In the final stages of the 2020-21 season, Chambers recovered from injury and started 10 games in the Premier League.

  In just 10 starts, the English right-back has provided 2 assists. He has shown great attacking and defensive sides of his game as he prepares himself to be Arsenal’s primary contender for the right-back slot.

### Midfielders

- **Pepe** – **7.5m**

  Nicolas Pepe has been a match winner for Mikel Arteta on multiple occasions last season across all competitions. A skilful winger who can cut on both sides and take you on at pace.

  A player of Pepe’s calibre usually provides points on a regular basis. Consistency is the key, which Pepe has been struggling with in his last season as a Gunner.

  He has made 29 appearances in the Premier League and scored 10 goals (tied with Aubameyang) along with an assist to his name. This season will define Pepe as a player in the Premier League and the Ivorian has all that it takes to succeed on English soil.

- **Saka** – **6.5m**

  Bukayo Saka has begun his career on a very bright note. The 19-year-old was impressive last season, scoring 5 goals and providing 3 assists in his 32 appearances with the club.

  A sharp and delightful campaign with England at the Euros has further increased his appeal as a strong FPL asset who has all the tools to succeed in the 2021-22 Premier League season.

  Available at 6.5m, he was Arsenal’s 4th-best player in the team in 2020-21. By the end of last season, Saka was a huge threat on the right-hand side of Arsenal’s midfield. His pace and silky skills will provide FPL owners with a lot of assists and goal-scoring potential.

- **Smith Rowe** – **5.5m**

  For years, Arsenal have lacked a midfielder that would run at opposition defenders and cause havoc in the penalty box. Ozil was the last gunner that was good at that specific art. Those that came to replace him did not really deliver.

  It seems as though Arsenal have found a player capable of doing the same. Emile Smith Rowe burst on to the scene in the second half of Arsenal’s campaign, where he contributed 2 goals and 4 assists in 20 appearances in the Premier League.

  Smith Rowe is a good FPL asset to fill up the third and fourth positions in midfield for your FPL team.

  There is a lot of promise shown by Smith Rowe and he is determined to start the season on a high note.

- **Partey** – **5.0m**

  Partey has a very small role to play in providing you with FPL points. Arteta will rely on him to help out in defence provided that he remains fit. However, it is not a worthwhile investment as he does not get into attacking positions more often. Partey is definitely a player to fill your bench.

### Forwards

- **Aubameyang** – **10.0m**

  Last season in the FPL, Aubameyang was positioned as a midfielder with a staggering 12.0m price tag. Expectations were high, but the Gabonese striker wouldn’t deliver.

  This time around, in 2021-22, Aubameyang is priced at 10.0m. Arteta has been rotating his stars forward in and around the playing 11. Although, he managed to score 10 goals in the previous season, in our opinion, there are much better assets than Aubameyang.

- **Lacazette** – **8.5m**

  The French centre-forward was the top-goal scorer for the Gunners in the 2020-21 season, where he tallied a total of 13 goals in the Premier League itself. Lacazette is the more clinical of the two forwards, and when Laca hits form, he goes on a pretty little run with goals and FPL points. Hop on Laca’s ship when it sails smoothly!
