Liverpool's Brazilian keeper is currently owned by **8.1%** of FPL managers worldwide. In his last 6 gameweeks, he's got **4 clean sheets** as he's accumulated a total of **31 FPL points.**

Currently, he remains one of the league's most productive player's in between the poles. There is no doubt that Alisson is not at his best so far this season, but he's got a really good tendency to pull out huge saves in the game every now and then.

With Covid finding its way into the league and taking away a few fixtures, in the goalkeeping category, Alisson is the go-to man for FPL managers out there in hunt for a differential. With Van Dijk (£6.7m) testing positive, the Reds will be without their key man against a Spurs side who's got the luxury to get enough rest and planning time to prepare for the game.

However, Liverpool's defense is still solid enough as Konate (£5.1m) has proved his worth in Jurgen Klopp's side in such a short time span. Hence, there is no reason why you should worry a lot about the consistency of the clean sheets that are out there on the horizon.

In GW17, Alisson scored 2 points in a 3-1 victory against Newcastle at Anfield. He lost his clean sheet to Jonjo Shelvey's (£5.3m) brilliant goal. It was a strike that the Brazilian just couldn't stop even if he made an attempt to dive at it.

So far this season, these are his stats:

| **Premier League** | Stats |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| Games Played       | 16    |
| Minutes played     | 1440  |
| Goals conceded     | 13    |
| Clean sheets       | 9     |
| Saves              | 23    |
| Penalties saved    | 0     |
| FPL points scored  | 74    |
| FPL Bonus Points   | 5     |

Liverpool face Spurs, Leeds, Brentford, Crystal Palace, Burnley and Norwich in their next 9 Premier League gameweeks. Those are fixtures you can bank on for the Reds keeper to keep clean sheets.

At the end of the day, he is a reliable keeper that you can bank on.

## 2. Laporte: £5.5m

The Spaniard is owned by just **3.4%** of FPL managers. Laporte has become one of Pep's most important centre-backs in the side. He has paired alongside Ruben Dias (£6.1m) really well in recent weeks and he is set to stamp his authority when the Citizens take on Newcastle United at St. James' Park.

Here are his stats so far this season:

| **Premier League**             | Stats |
| ------------------------------ | ----- |
| Games Played                   | 13    |
| Minutes played                 | 1093  |
| Goals scored                   | 7     |
| Assists                        | 8     |
| Avg FPL points scored per game | 4.30  |
| FPL points scored              | 56    |
| FPL Bonus Points               | 3     |

In GW17, Laporte started the game against Leeds United as he kept a clean sheet and scored a total of **6 FPL points**. Yes, Laporte might not be an attractive pick when you look at his overall stats, but in a week where Covid has led to the postponement of a few games, we prefer going for the safest pick this week.

Overall, if you decide to invest in Laporte, it isn't a bad investment either. Laporte is a surprise package in terms of points from this Man City side as he is one of their main targets when it comes to set-pieces. We expect Laporte to continue starting games for the Citizens. At the same time, he has the leading fantasy efficiency in the league.

With Newcastle poor in defending set-pieces, you can expect the Spaniard to fancy his chances in front of goal during set-pieces.

## 3. Saka: £6.2m

Arsenal's youngster is currently owned by 9.8% of FPL managers. Saka's form has been slightly on the rise as he is picking up points lately. His numbers in terms of goals isn't standing out so far with the quality that he has in his boots, but his assist numbers are rising slowly.

Here are his stats so far this season:

| **Premier League**             | Stats |
| ------------------------------ | ----- |
| Games Played                   | 17    |
| Minutes played                 | 1260  |
| Goals scored                   | 2     |
| Assists                        | 5     |
| Avg FPL points scored per game | 3.76  |
| FPL points scored              | 64    |
| FPL Bonus Points               | 3     |

In GW17, Saka scored a total of **6 FPL points** as he provided an **assist** and got a clean sheet point as well against West Ham. He passed the eye test as well in that game as he was a constant threat to a well established Hammers defensive line. In that game, he had **2 shots on goal**, **1** really good **successful cross** and **4 key passes**.

Overall, with the kind of form that he has shown in the last couple of weeks, you can expect him to get on his bike and ram through the Leeds defensive line that was torn apart midweek against Man City.
