## Real Madrid: Player ratings

### 1. Thibaut Courtois: 8

The Belgian shot-stopper was just world class once again in a game where it mattered the most for Real Madrid to keep a significant lead amongst the rest. He was sensational yet again as he made 3 crucial saves to deny their derby rivals.

In total, the Belgian made 7 saves and he even took a blow to his nose as he made a save in the dying minutes of stoppage time. He was in control and in command.

### 2. Dani Carvajal: 6.5

The Spaniard deserves a lot of credit for his performance on the day as he was one of those who put in the hard yards to deny Carrasco to emerge forward. He kept things simple, went forward as usual, but squared it along to Modric, Kroos or Casemiro in midfield rather than going for his cross into the box. He was solid and completed all 47 passes in the game with a pass completion rate of 100%.

### 3. Eder Militao: 7

The Brazilian was impressive yet again along with Alaba. He read the play well and was too quick to pounce on any opportunity to poke the ball away from the danger zone.

The visitor's couldn't take him on for pace.

### 4. David Alaba: 7.5

The Austrian centre back was too good for the visitors to cope with. Alaba was quick on the floor and had a really good presence in the air as well.

He continues to be a main part of Real Madrid's backline and he guides his troops well too. The Austrian was able to read play well and intercepted a lot of the visitors' incoming threats.

He got into an argument with Luis Suarez (who must've said something that triggered him) and got booked.

### 5. Ferland Mendy: 6

The French left back wasn't able to create a significant impact from the left hand side. He teamed up well with Vini, but there were times when he gave away possession cheaply.

He nearly found Vini with a low drilled cross, but the Brazilian was a few inches away. Mendy made a few fouls in the game and was unlucky that he wasn't sent off with about 10-11 odd minutes left on the clock.

**Stats:**

**Tackles**: 3

**Interceptions**: 1

**Pass completion**: 90%

### 6. Luka Modric: 10

Well, we've got no words for the Croatian magician. He was simply amazingly amazing and extremely pleasing to the eye. His efforts on and off the ball were just a pure example that he is not done at the fine age of 36. At this rate, he clearly deserves a contract extension at the greatest club in Europe.

The magician left his mark all over the pitch. He was constantly on the charge in midfield looking to find solutions on his own. He was focused on this game and even won a few tackles and made a few vital interceptions in midfield. He certainly left the boys of Atletico Madrid in his own magician hat as he came up with solutions time and time again. Los Blancos's first goal started out due to Modric's fine interception.

He didn't put a foot wrong in the game and we clearly understand why Carlo Ancelotti went all in and hugged him after the final whistle. Adding to that, while play was going on, Modric always seemed to calm the situation down by dancing through a couple of Atleti players and going into a safe zone where the nerves could be rested. He is certainly a Big. Game. Player!

**Stats:**

**Minutes played**: 90

**Successful Dribbles**: 4 (The most by a player in the game)

**Passes Completed**: 73

**Duels won**: 9

**Recoveries**: 4

### 7. Casemiro: 7

The Brazilian defensive midfielder was a huge part in the way Real Madrid pushed forward. He was the block in front of Real's 4-man defense that allowed Modric and Kroos to turn up the heat going forward. He was good and physical as well, giving it to the opponents when it mattered the most.

He has been criticized lately for not being able to stamp his authority in midfield, but on a big game day, against your derby rivals, Casemiro stepped up and had a really good game on the ball.

**Stats:**

**Long balls completed**: 7/8

**Tackles won**: 2

**Interceptions**: 3

### 8. Toni Kroos: 8

The German kept his high standards in this big game as well and was able to find a pass even when he was in tight spaces. The visitors looked to be physical on him and landed a few tackles on him, but the German continued on his merry ways and completed 96 passes in the game.

### 9. Marco Asensio: 7.5

Carlo Ancelotti made a call to start Asensio over Rodrygo in a game which had its own implications. The right-wing position is the only area of concern so far with the likes of Rodrygo and Asensio competing for that starting spot.

However, the manager went with the Spaniard in his starting XI and he continued to impress by scoring the second goal for Real Madrid. It is true that Asensio wasn't at his best in the game. He was unable to burst forward with real comfort and flare, but when Jovic and Vinicius broke through, Asensio's eyes lit up when Vini Jr. rolled the ball for him as the Spaniard lashed at it with real venom beyond the reach of Jan Oblak.

It was a good game for the Spaniard and he will be hoping that he continues this fine form of his.

### 10. Karim Benzema: 7

The French striker made it to the starting XI for Real Madrid after large looming doubts circled around the club regarding his availability after suffering from an injury a few days ago.

However, Benzema started the game and rounded off a perfect counter attacking goal with a world class vollet into the net as he continued to keep his doubters quiet. He was a bit weary by the end of the first half as he gave away the ball on a few occasions when Atleti were looking to get back in the game.

He was eventually subbed off at half time which was likely as a precautionary measure.

### 11. Vini Jr: 8

The Brazilian winger just keeps reaching for the stars as he continues his fine devastating form in front of goal for Real Madrid in the form of two assists. He was so good on the ball and kept the Atleti boys chasing after him.

For his first assist, Vini Jr. had the composure and presence of mind to calm down, look up and find the lofted pass for Benzema to capitalize on.

For his second assist, once again, he was on the break, looked as though he would go through on goal, but he kept his nerve and rolled the ball to Asensio who slotted it home.

Ancelotti seems like he's getting the best of Vinicius at this moment as he has become a beast of his own in front of goal alongside Karim Benzema.

He rightly got a standing ovation at the Bernabeu as he was subbed off late in the second half. Brilliant display from Vini in a big game.

## Substitutes

### 12. Luka Jovic: 6

He came on for Benzema at the start of the second half and looked to make an impact. His movements were smart, but they were slightly rusty, which is understandable.

However, he came into the fold when he played his part for Madrid's second goal as he controlled the ball well and set Vinicius on his way. He will keep growing if he gets his opportunities.

### 13. Nacho: 4

The veteran versatile defender came on for Carvajal with just 10 minutes to spare on the clock and ensured that Atletico Madrid were not going to cause havoc from the right hand side of Real Madrid's defense.

### 14. Fede Valverde: 4

He came on for Vini Jr. but he couldn't get in the rhythm of the game and had a misplaced pass when Nacho was steaming down the right hand side.

### 15. Rodrygo: N/A
