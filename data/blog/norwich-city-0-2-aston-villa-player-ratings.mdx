The youngster was phenomenal. His injection of pace caused a lot of panic for the hosts and he ended up scoring a really good goal. Drove past the opponent's midfield and ensured that he gave his side a commanding lead.

### 2. Emiliano Martinez: 6

He probably had a small picnic out there.

### 3. Matthew Cash: 8

Worked tirelessly to create an overload on the right hand side of Villa's attack. Showed good injection of pace that troubled the Norwich back line. His work was nearly entirely done in the attacking half.

### 4. Ezri Konsa: 7

He was out there at the halfway line to gather anything that was pumped forward by Norwich. At times, he went forward and added an extra body to keep the pressure on the hosts.

### 5. Tyrone Mings: 7

He probably had a few cups of coffee out there.

### 6. Matt Targett: 8

Similar to Matty Cash, Targett was also enjoying the game bombarding forward down the left-hand side. He was constantly bothering the Norwich backline with his presence upfront.

### 7. Douglas Luiz: 8

The Brazilian had a walk in the park and he was barely asked to sprint around and contribute defensively.

### 8. John McGinn: 8

He was strong, determined and focused throughout the game. He had an attempt on goal that questioned Tim Krul. He constantly looked for a forward pass onto Watkins and his fellow teammates.

### 9. Ashley Young: 5.5

The veteran couldn't really push his side forward for large parts of the game. His age probably restricted him from offering more from an attacking point of view.

However, he gave Matty Cash the license to push forward continuously.

### 10. Buendia: 8.5

It was a good day out for the Argentine at his former club. He linked up really well with Watkins and McGinn and he carried the ball forward superbly asking a lot of questions of the hosts.

### 11. Ollie Watkins: 7.5

In the first half, he offered a lot in an attacking midfield position for Aston Villa. He linked up well with his teammates and looked to create play initially. As the game wore on, he wanted to get on the scoresheet desperately. He got his chance in the 87th minute of the game, while he also grabbed an assist.

## Substitutes

### 12. Danny Ings: 4

The former Liverpool striker was desperate to get a goal in the game which affected the chemistry between him and Watkins. It will take time for both of them to get used to the way the team plays under Steven Gerrard.

### 13. Carney Chukwuemeka: 5

He came on and provided an assist for Watkins. Had a good cameo performance on the night.

### 14. Axel Tuanzebe: 5

The manager just wanted him to get his legs warm for a bit. Wonder if he did get warm with what Norwich had upfront.

## Norwich City player ratings

### 1. Tim Krul: 6.5

He was probably their stand-out player on the field for Dean Smith. He's been continuously making save after save, week in and week out. Unfortunately, he couldn't bail his side out against a Villa side that brought their swords out.

He'll probably need defenders that have a much better shield on them. Made a few decent and testing saves in both halves.

### 2. Max Aarons: 4

He started the game pretty well, but then lost focus and determination as the game wore on. Seemed like he wasn't physically ready for the game after the likes of Cristiano Ronaldo and Bruno Fernandes visited the shores a few days ago.

He had a really poor game. He was out of the races.

### 3. Ben Gibson: 5

He was decent enough on the night and marked his defender's pretty well.

### 4. Ozan Kabak: 3

The Turkish international got off to a decent start in the game, but eventually got injured and still managed to carry on.

However, that decision to carry on was a huge liability to his side as he gave Ramsey the space to find his spot. He got subbed off before halftime which is not a good sign for the club as their centre-back issues keep getting worse.

### 5. Brandon Williams: 5.5

The Man Utd loanee was the pick of the bunch in the back four for Dean Smith's side. He was outplayed at times by the likes of Matty Cash, Buendia and John McGinn, but he put in the work rate and effort required.

He was one of the Norwich boys that showed some endeavor and fight, but it wasn't enough to keep his side from losing.

### 6. Billy Gilmour: 2

Chelsea's loanee was far from poor in this game. He had a nightmare. He gave away the ball needlessly at times. Made a few square and backward passes.

Eventually, he gave the ball away for Villa's opening goal. He made a weak challenge for the visitor's second and failed to pick himself up throughout the second half.

### 7. Jacob SÃ¸rensen: 5

Defensively, he was impressive. He was at the right place at the right time helping out his ailing defense.

However, he couldn't make a difference with the ball going forward.

### 8. Kenny McLean: 4

The midfielder started the game well. He was decent in the opening exchanges of the game as he won a few challenges. He struck one sweet on the volley in the first half, but Villa's man came over and blocked his shot which seemed goal bound.

Beyond that, he had a pretty average game later on as he gave away possession needlessly.

### 9. Przemyslaw Placheta: 3

Norwich's Polish forward looked to create his own spark by bringing out his tricks from his bag, but he couldn't influence the game in a positive way for the hosts.

### 10. Todd Cantwell: 1

He had a night which he has to forget. He'll be rolling around his bed having an issue sleeping.

He couldn't Influence the game at all. He couldn't pick a pass and ran out of idea's during the game. There was no defensive work rate from him as well. Had a horrendous moment when he back-heeled the ball out of play in the first half.

Eventually, he ran straight down the tunnel after being subbed off at the hour mark.

### 11. Teemu Pukki: 4

If the Finnish international deserves any credit in the game, then he deserves it due to his defensive work rate. Sadly, he didn't receive much service upfront from the boys in behind him.

It was a game where he needed his former teammate, Emiliano Buendia to supply him a few goal-bound opportunities.

## Substitutes

### 12. Sam Byram: 5

His introduction on the field helped his side become defensively solid when it came to the back 3 (leaving Aarons out).

### 13. Adam Idah: 3

He came on for Cantwell and he couldn't find his range during the game.

### 14. Kieran Dowell: 3

Looked to create something for the hosts by playing on the right wings, but again, he couldn't make it happen like the rest of his teammates.
