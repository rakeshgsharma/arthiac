The Man City midfielder is currently owned by **9.7%** of FPL managers. His last start in the Premier League came against Leeds at home where he scored a total of **12 FPL points** as he scored a goal, provided an assist and collected a bonus point.

Here are his stats so far this season:

| **Premier League** | Stats |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| Games Played       | 12    |
| Minutes played     | 835   |
| Goals scored       | 4     |
| FPL points scored  | 62    |
| FPL Bonus Points   | 6     |
| Assists            | 4     |

He has been one of the most sold players in the last week as he's been used as a sub off late.

However, the Man City youngster will be amongst the favorites to start in their upcoming fixture against a resilient Brentford side away from home.

His pace and decisiveness will be key if Man City are going to score goals and create opportunities away from home in hostile territory. His creativity will be key against Brentford and our suggestion is that Pep will start him **this week** in the front 3 that he deploys in every game.

Man City take on Arsenal and Chelsea in GW21 and GW22. Pep Guardiola probably rested Foden as he wanted him fresh for the big games. To get his boy to find form, he will certainly pull the trigger and start Foden this week. We can certainly expect Foden to start against Arsenal and Chelsea.

## 2. Maddison: £6.8m

Leicester's attacking midfielder is currently owned by **9.0%** of FPL managers worldwide. He's been a player that has gone under the radar for a long time as the other candidates in the similar price range (Raphinha £6.5m, Bernardo Silva £7.6m, Gallagher £6.1m, Mount £7.7m and Jota £8.1m) have been performing much more consistently. Adding to that, they've been injury free.

However, he's been finding his groove lately as he's been finding his teammates as well as the net on a regular basis in the last 5 gameweeks. In the previous 5 Premier League games, he's scored a whopping **53 FPL points** as he averaged **10.6 FPL points per game**.

Here are his season stats:

| **Premier League** | Stats |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| Games Played       | 17    |
| Minutes played     | 1108  |
| Goals scored       | 5     |
| FPL points scored  | 79    |
| FPL Bonus Points   | 10    |
| Assists            | 5     |

In the last two gameweeks for Leicester City (GW16 and GW19), Maddison has been on top of his game. In GW16, against Newcastle United, he scored 16 points as he scored once and provided 2 assists in the game. Adding to that, he got 2 bonus points. On that day, he was such a compelling creative force for the Magpies to contain. He continued his fine form the following game against the Citizens as he came up with FPL goods in the second half as he scored once and provided an assist as well. He was rewarded with 1 bonus point as well.

Leicester take on Liverpool in gameweek 20 with Norwich, Burnley and Brighton following up. With Brendan Rodgers finding ways to click upfront, it will be an exciting and interesting FPL option in case you decide to invest in Maddison.

## 3. Lucas Moura: £6.5m

At the start of the season, Lucas Moura was an FPL option that wasn't in contention around that £6.5m FPL price tag. He was an isolated FPL option.

However, with the arrival of Antonio Conte at Spurs, Lucas Moura found a new lease in life in front of goal and he sits on top of the pile to come up with the goods in GW20 as well.

Here as his stats so far this season:

| **Premier League** | Stats |
| ------------------ | ----- |
| Games Played       | 15    |
| Minutes played     | 1103  |
| Goals scored       | 2     |
| FPL points scored  | 54    |
| FPL Bonus Points   | 4     |
| Assists            | 3     |

Yes, his stats up above don't look promising, but his numbers in recent weeks have been eye-catching. Those are numbers that can't be ignored. On top of that, he's been a regular starter for Antonio Conte apart from the odd game.

In GW19, against Crystal Palace, Lucas Moura scored a mouth-watering **17 FPL points** where he scored a goal, provided 2 assists and collected all 3 bonus points. It was a sensational performance by the Brazilian as he kept his fine form running by scoring big in GW19. He is currently one of the in-form players in the league. Adding to that, he is just the type of player that Conte loves. An aggressive and hard worker with and without the ball.

Spurs take on Southampton in gameweek 20 and Conte will be relying heavily on the space and creativity of his Brazilian forward. We reckon that he will be the silent assassin for Spurs against the Saints. He will be the key point of difference if Spurs need to claim all 3 points away at Saint Mary's stadium.
