Our next stop is Lancashire, where we look at Burnley from an FPL perspective. As FPL managers, we mostly want to fill our 15-man squad with premium players from all the big teams in the Premier League. It would be an elite fantasy team that you would create.

Unfortunately, that is not the case in the real FPL world, where you have a certain budget (£100m) to get your fantasy team up and running, and that is what makes Fantasy Premier League a unique game and friendly competition on its own.

We need to allocate our funds and find a way to get "cheaper quality players" within our 15-man squad, and this is why we’ve bought you a ticket to Lancashire, where we will look at Burnley and their assets, which we would love to spend a few pounds on.

As always, we look into every department that "The Clarets" have to offer for FPL managers around the world that would want to consider a potential opening for Burnley asset (s) to enter their teams.

## Burnley in 2020-21

---

The men in claret and blue always come knocking when time calls. There were fears that Burnley would succumb to relegation, especially after they had gone through a Premier League season without spending a sizable amount during the summer and winter transfer markets.

Concerns rose as the season progressed, especially at the beginning of the 2020-21 campaign, where Burnley got off to a very slow start as they collected just 2 points off their opening 7 league games.

Survival hopes were restored when Burnley took all 3 points in store against Crystal Palace with a 1-0 win at Turf Moor. The following week, Burnley were hammered 5-0 by Pep Guardiola’s Manchester City at the Etihad. But, that result was a blessing in disguise.

A week later, Burnley went ahead and claimed 8 points from 4 league games, which included a 1-0 win over Arsenal at the Emirates stadium, which lifted them above the drop zone.

Since then, Burnley have been fairly consistent in getting league points on the pitch. The men in Claret and Blue pulled out one of the surprises of the 2020-21 season when they humbled Liverpool to a 1-0 defeat at Anfield.

It was Liverpool’s first defeat at Anfield since 2017, which was more than 3-and-a-half-years since Liverpool tasted defeat on their turf, but Sean Dyche and his Claret army pulled out a season-defining win that turned Burnley’s fortunes around as they recorded two consecutive victories after taking Aston Villa down at Turf Moor.

It was another successful season for Sean Dyche and his men to stay up in the Premier League, which is an achievement in itself for a Premier League club that doesn't spend as much as their counterparts do.

## What to Expect from Burnley in FPL?

---

Burnley are usually known for their defensive strengths as they have assets that are worth mentioning from time to time that could provide FPL managers with good value for the pounds they spend on Burnley’s assets.

Additionally, Burnley also have a few assets upfront that could provide a decent FPL point return if and when they hit the ground running.

Burnley follow a systematic 4-4-2 formation where they keep it simple, compact and tough. Defensively, Burnley have always been a tough nut to crack and they will continue to be a tougher nut to crack as the 2021-22 season comes along in less than 3 weeks' time.

Additionally, as FPL managers, we also need affordable options up front to provide us with points. Sean Dyche has recently changed the approach that his boys take in the final few weeks of the 2020-21 campaign.

Instead of sitting back and soaking up pressure, Burnley have been attacking right from the first minute to the last. This change in approach was first implemented by Sean Dyche in the 4-0 hammering by Tottenham Hotspur at the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium.

## Players as “Potential” Regular Starters

---

### Goalkeepers

1.  **Pope** - **£5.5m** - Over the last few seasons, Nick Pope has always been a very reliable source of FPL fantasy points. He pulls out save after save on multiple occasions to keep his side in the game.

    Here’s an upside: whenever Burnley keep a clean-sheet with a 0-0 scoreline, Nick Pope gets Bonus Points. He has proven himself on a number of occasions to be Burnley’s number 1 in goal. He has secured his place as the go-to man for Burnley between the posts.

    Unfortunately, last season went slightly downhill in terms of his performances as he was struggling with knee injuries on a regular basis from time to time. A head injury also kept him out for a few weeks due to concussion.

    If Nick Pope is fit, he is set to pull out multiple saves. Considering the fact that Burnley have taken an attacking approach lately, it provides a window for Nick Pope to provide FPL managers with multiple saves.

    **Our Opinion?**- Just a touch too expensive. Watch out for the Burnley defence and their style of play before investing £5.5m in a goalkeeper.

### Defenders

1.  **Tarkowski** - **Centre-back** - **£5.0m** - James Tarkowski is a colossal figure at the heart of Burnley's defence. He is a huge player for Burnley in their back-line. Tarkowski also carries a real threat in set-pieces when Burnley are on the attack.

    James Tarkowski is the primary target for Burnley’s set-piece takers as he has a really good header in his locker.

    James Tarkowski is a regular starter and carries impressive defensive and attacking numbers with him. He is a strong tackler of the ball, physically hard to get past and wins a lot of aerial duels in the air, especially when it comes to defending set-pieces. The following are his Premier League stats:

    | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | Premier League <br /> 2018-19 | 35      | 1     | 0       |
    | Premier League <br /> 2019-20 | 38      | 2     | 2       |
    | Premier League <br /> 2020-21 | 36      | 3     | 1       |

    Those stats go to show that Burnley depend on him for his goals and aerial threat on a regular basis. On the dim side of things, his recent season (2020-21) has not provided FPL managers with joy and points galore.

    **Our Opinion?** - Pick him when the fixtures are kind to Burnley.

2.  **Mee** - **Centre-back** - **£5.0m** - Ben Mee is the heartbeat of this Burnley defence. He is at the centre of all that happens around Burnley when they are asked to defend. His strength is that he reads the game well and positions himself accordingly.

    At 31 years of age, Ben Mee is still going strong and he is set to be the man that marshalls the Burnley back-line in the 2021-22 campaign.

    He gets regular tackles time and time again, and he is very good at making crucial blocks at crucial moments at certain stages of the game.

    Offensively, Ben Mee, along with James Tarkowski, is the primary target to aim for to get a goal or two. The 2020-21 campaign was the best for Ben Mee as he registered 2 goals, which equalled his previous best of 2 goals, which was back in the 2014-15 Premier League season.

3.  **Taylor** - **Left-back** - **£4.5m** - Charlie Taylor has an impressive left-foot that he is gifted with that can supply quality deliveries in both open play and set-pieces as well. He is an essential component when Burnley are on the attack.

    Burnley’s goals are largely scored aerially or from deliveries that arrive from both wings. This is where Charlie Taylor’s attacking threat is a real source of FPL points.

    With Burnley having an attack-minded approach to games, it will be of no surprise that Charlie Taylor will be at the helm of creating chances.

    **Our Opinion?**- Not enough numbers to suggest that he is "the one" at £4.5m. But, he could be a good bench option and he could come in handy for clean sheet points as Burnley thrive on them.

### Midfielders

1.  **McNeil** - **£6.0m** - At 21 years of age, Dwight McNeil is arguably Burnley’s most creative player on the pitch with the ball at his feet. He is a talented youngster on whom Burnley depend to draw defenders closer to him, out of their positions and open up spaces for his teammates to run into acres of free space.

    He is also a very good supplier of the ball when it comes to open play or whether he is on set-piece duty.

    His numbers are a slight concern. Though he is talented, the numbers don’t prove his skill and quality when he runs towards the goal.

    | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | Premier League <br /> 2018-19 | 21      | 3     | 5       |
    | Premier League <br /> 2019-20 | 38      | 2     | 6       |
    | Premier League <br /> 2020-21 | 36      | 2     | 5       |

    **Our Opinion?** - Watch out if and when he gets a couple of goals at the start of the Premier League campaign.

2.  **Westwood** - **£5.5m** - Ashley Westwood has been the man to provide for Burnley over the last few seasons. His contribution in taking set-pieces is an essential factor for Burnley to score goals.

    Last season, he registered his career best figures in terms of goals scored. Below are his statistics:

    | Season  | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | 2018-19 | 34      | 2     | 7       |
    | 2019-20 | 35      | 2     | 6       |
    | 2020-21 | 38      | 3     | 3       |

    His numbers are pretty good for a team that doesn't create many chances when they are on the ball on the attack. Yet, Ashley Westwood has a few numbers for FPL managers to consider.

    **Our Opinion?** - Avoid him.

3.  **Gudmundsson** - **£5.5m** - Johann Gudmundsson has been an irregular player for Burnley in the previous 3 Premier League campaigns. His stop-and-start Premier League campaigns are usually cut down due to injuries that he keeps picking up from time to time.

    In the 2020-21 season, there was a stage mid-way through the season where Gudmundsson was on a roll with a ball on his feet creating a fair few chances for his team-mates.

    Last season, he notched up 2 goals in just 22 appearances for Burnley in the Premier League.

    **Our Opinion?** - Avoid him in your FPL teams.

4.  **Brownhill** - **£4.5m** - Josh Brownhill has been a regular starter for Burnley in their midfield in the previous campaign. Although he still doesn’t have any goals to show for FPL managers in Claret and blue colours.

    He doesn’t look like an attractive option at £4.5m and it is best that you keep him on your bench in case you make an investment in him.

### Forwards

1.  **Wood - £7.0m** - Chris Wood had another stellar season in his fourth campaign with the Clarets. Though Burnley have been relatively poor in the 2020-21 Premier League campaign, Chris Wood has always been there up front in front of goal to get Burnley over the line.

    Chris Wood also created history as he was the first Kiwi to get a Premier League hattrick.

    | Season                        | Matches | Goals | Assists |
    | ----------------------------- | ------- | ----- | ------- |
    | Premier League <br /> 2017-18 | 24      | 10    | 1       |
    | Premier League <br /> 2018-19 | 38      | 10    | 2       |
    | Premier League <br /> 2019-20 | 32      | 14    | 1       |
    | Premier League <br /> 2020-21 | 33      | 12    | 3       |

    His hat-trick was also followed by a few records that he had broken. A few of them are:

    - Burnley’s all time top goal-scorer
    - The first player to score a 1st half hat-trick since Micheal Owen in 1998
    - Registered 10+ goals for four consecutive Premier League seasons
